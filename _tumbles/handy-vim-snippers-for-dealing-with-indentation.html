My contribution to the tabs vs spaces war. It's very silly to use spaces, but when you contribute to open source you have to do it, so here's how I cope:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/simlrh/7c64840c4719bf86b98f5a2622c15b4e.js"></script>

Tabs for indentation by default, but when you open a new file press &lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Space&gt; to highlight lines indented with spaces. If you see red everywhere, it's a space indented file. &lt;Leader&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; switches to space indentation, and &lt;Leader&gt;j&lt;Space&gt;&lt;Number&gt;&lt;cr&gt; sets the number of spaces per indent.
